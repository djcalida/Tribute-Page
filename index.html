        <p id="p1">Ada Lovelace is considered the first computer programmer. Even though she wrote about a computer, the Analytical Engine, that was never built, she realized that the computer could follow a series of simple instructions, a program, to perform a complex calculation.</p>

        <div class="p2">
            <p>☛ Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.</p>
            <p>☛ Born in 1815, Lovelace lived a tragically short life, dying at the age of 36. However, her legacy has inspired generations of young women and girls to study STEM subjects and pursue careers in technology and science.</p>
            <p>☛ Lovelace is recorded as having had a serious gambling problem, which contributed to her declining finances and led to her pawning the family’s diamonds.</p>
            <p>At the age of 12, Lovelace conceptualised a flying machine after studying the anatomy of birds and the suitability of various materials. She illustrated her plans to build a winged flying apparatus before she began to think about powered flight.</p>
            <p>☛ She wrote to her mother: “I have got a scheme to make a thing in the form of a horse with a steam engine in the inside so contrived as to move an immense pair of wings, fixed on the outside of the horse, in such a manner as to carry it up into the air while a person sits on its back.”</p>
            <p>☛Although she never knew her father, who died abroad when she was eight years old, Lovelace was deeply fascinated by him and requested to be buried alongside Lord Byron in the family vault inside the Church of St Mary Magdalene, Hucknall.
            </p>
            <p>☛ Both Lovelace and her father died at the age of 36. It is believed that she likely died from uterine cancer.</p>
            <p>☛ Died in November 27, 1852, At Marylebone, London, United Kingdom</p>
            <p>☛ She has 3 children which is, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_King-Noel,_Viscount_Ockham">[Byron King-Noel, Viscount Ockham]</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Blunt,_15th_Baroness_Wentworth"> [Anne Blunt, 15th Baroness Wentworth],</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_King-Milbanke,_2nd_Earl_of_Lovelace"> [King-Milbanke, 2nd Earl of Lovelace].</a></p>
